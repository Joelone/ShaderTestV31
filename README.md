Cocos2d v3.1 Lighting and Blur Shader Example

The source is heavily documented on how to create a shader and apply it to a set of sprites. Cocos2d v3.1 changes both the batch node process (deprecated CCSpriteBatchNode in favor of CCNode) and the shader process (new format with new/different default uniforms/attributes). I have not tested this at all for performance and may (most likely) perform horribly on the forsaken first generation Retina iPad (e.g. iPad3,3).

Also, please see the following write-ups which future explain the Blur and Lighting Shader code for cocos2d v3.1+.
